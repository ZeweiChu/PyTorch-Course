    "Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a GAN?\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are a framework for teaching a DL model to capture the training\n",
    "data’s distribution so we can generate new data from that same\n",
    "distribution. GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and first\n",
    "described in the paper `Generative Adversarial\n",
    "Nets <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__.\n",
    "They are made of two distinct models, a *generator* and a\n",
    "*discriminator*. The job of the generator is to spawn ‘fake’ images that\n",
    "look like the training images. The job of the discriminator is to look\n",
    "at an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a\n",
    "fake image from the generator. During training, the generator is\n",
    "constantly trying to outsmart the discriminator by generating better and\n",
    "better fakes, while the discriminator is working to become a better\n",
    "detective and correctly classify the real and fake images. The\n",
    "equilibrium of this game is when the generator is generating perfect\n",
    "fakes that look as if they came directly from the training data, and the\n",
    "discriminator is left to always guess at 50% confidence that the\n",
    "generator output is real or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets define some notation to be used throughout tutorial starting\n",
    "with the discriminator. Let $x$ be data representing an image.\n",
    "$D(x)$ is the discriminator network which outputs the (scalar)\n",
    "probability that $x$ came from training data rather than the\n",
    "generator. Here, since we are dealing with images the input to\n",
    "$D(x)$ is an image of HWC size 3x64x64. Intuitively, $D(x)$\n",
    "should be HIGH when $x$ comes from training data and LOW when\n",
    "$x$ comes from the generator. $D(x)$ can also be thought of\n",
    "as a traditional binary classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the generator’s notation, let $z$ be a latent space vector\n",
    "sampled from a standard normal distribution. $G(z)$ represents the\n",
    "generator function which maps the latent vector $z$ to data-space.\n",
    "The goal of $G$ is to estimate the distribution that the training\n",
    "data comes from ($p_{data}$) so it can generate fake samples from\n",
    "that estimated distribution ($p_g$).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $D(G(z))$ is the probability (scalar) that the output of the\n",
    "generator $G$ is a real image. As described in `Goodfellow’s\n",
    "paper <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__,\n",
    "$D$ and $G$ play a minimax game in which $D$ tries to\n",
    "maximize the probability it correctly classifies reals and fakes\n",
    "($logD(x)$), and $G$ tries to minimize the probability that\n",
    "$D$ will predict its outputs are fake ($log(1-D(G(x)))$).\n",
    "From the paper, the GAN loss function is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\\underset{G}{\\text{min}} \\underset{D}{\\text{max}}V(D,G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}\\big[logD(x)\\big] + \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim p_{z}(z)}\\big[log(1-D(G(x)))\\big]\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, the solution to this minimax game is where\n",
    "$p_g = p_{data}$, and the discriminator guesses randomly if the\n",
    "inputs are real or fake. However, the convergence theory of GANs is\n",
    "still being actively researched and in reality models do not always\n",
    "train to this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a DCGAN?\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "A DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it\n",
    "explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the\n",
    "discriminator and generator, respectively. It was first described by\n",
    "Radford et. al. in the paper `Unsupervised Representation Learning With\n",
    "Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial\n",
    "Networks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf>`__. The discriminator\n",
    "is made up of strided\n",

    "layers, `batch\n",

    "activations. The input is a 3x64x64 input image and the output is a\n",
    "scalar probability that the input is from the real data distribution.\n",
    "The generator is comprised of\n",
    "`convolutional-transpose <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d>`__\n",
    "layers, batch norm layers, and\n",
    "`ReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#relu>`__ activations. The\n",
    "input is a latent vector, $z$, that is drawn from a standard\n",
    "normal distribution and the output is a 3x64x64 RGB image. The strided\n",
    "conv-transpose layers allow the latent vector to be transformed into a\n",
    "volume with the same shape as an image. In the paper, the authors also\n",
    "give some tips about how to setup the optimizers, how to calculate the\n",
    "loss functions, and how to initialize the model weights, all of which\n",
    "will be explained in the coming sections.\n",

    "terms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending\n",

    "calculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct\n",

    "batch through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(1-D(G(z)))$),\n",
    "and *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the\n",
    "gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we\n",
    "call a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\n",
    "minimizing $log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes.\n",
    "As mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\n",
    "gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\n",
    "instead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish\n",
    "this by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the\n",
    "Discriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\n",
    "G’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters\n",
    "with an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real\n",

    "$log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $log(1-x)$\n",
    "part) which is exactly what we want.\n",
